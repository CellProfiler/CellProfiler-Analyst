CellProfiler Analyst (CPA) provides tools for classifying biological images and exploring and visualizing multidimensional data (particularly from high-throughput experiments) that has been extracted from companion image analysis software CellProfiler.

CellProfiler Analystâ€™s primary tools:

* **Image Gallery** displays (full and cell) images with a variety of filter options and can be used interactively with other tools.

* **Classifier** enables cell and field-of-view-level classification of multiple phenotypes using popular supervised machine learning models.

* **Plate Viewer** displays data according to the spatial layout of the experiment, such as a multi-well plate or microarray.

* **Scatter Plot**, **Histogram**, and **Density Plot** display numerical data.

* **Table Viewer** displays numerical and text data in a spreadsheet format, where data points can be clicked to display images.

* **Normalization Tool** creates a new datatable with normalized and feature-selected columns.

The CellProfiler project is based at the Broad Institute Imaging Platform. It was started by `Anne E. Carpenter <http://www.broadinstitute.org/~anne/>`_ and `Thouis (Ray) Jones <http://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people/thouis-ray-jones>`_
in the laboratories of David M. Sabatini and Polina Golland at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and MIT's CSAIL. CellProfiler Analyst is tested on MacOS 10.15, 11.2, Windows 7 and 10, and to a lesser extent Linux. Running the software from Linux currently requires use of the source code, which is beyond the scope of this document.
