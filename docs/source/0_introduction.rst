CellProfiler Analyst (CPA) provides tools for exploring and analyzing multidimensional data, particularly data from high-throughput, image-based experiments analyzed by its companion image analysis software, CellProfiler.

CellProfiler Analyst’s primary tools:

* **Classifier** can be quickly trained using supervised machine learning to recognize complicated and subtle distinctions between objects in images, enabling automatic scoring of hundreds of millions of objects.

- **Image Viewer** displays images interactively with other tools.

* **Table Viewer** displays numerical and text data in a spreadsheet format, where data points can be clicked to display images.

- **Plate Viewer** is a tool for exploration of data according to the spatial layout of the experiment, such as a multi-well plate or microarray.

* **Scatter Plot**, **Histogram**, and **Density Plot** display numerical data, where data points can be clicked to display images (latter feature coming soon).

The CellProfiler project is based at the Broad Institute Imaging Platform. It was started by `Anne E. Carpenter <http://www.broadinstitute.org/~anne/>`_ and `Thouis (Ray) Jones <http://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people/thouis-ray-jones>`_
in the laboratories of David M. Sabatini and Polina Golland at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and MIT's CSAIL. `David Dao <http://daviddao.de>`_ currently leads the development of CellProfiler Analyst. CellProfiler Analyst is primarily tested on MacOS 10.4, 10.5, and Windows XP, and to a lesser extent Linux. It has also been shown to work on MacOS 10.6. Running the software from Linux currently requires use of the source code, which is beyond the scope of this document.

CellProfiler Analyst is distributed under the BSD-3 Clause (see LICENSE.txt).
