# ==== Dynamic Groups ====
# Here you can define groupings to choose from when classifier scores your experiment.  (eg: per-well)
# This is OPTIONAL, you may leave "groups = ".
# FORMAT:
#   groups     =  comma separated list of group names (MUST END IN A COMMA IF THERE IS ONLY ONE GROUP)
#   group_XXX  =  MySQL select statement that returns image-keys and group-keys.  This will be associated with the group name "XXX" from above.
# EXAMPLE GROUPS:
#   groups               =  Well, Gene, Well+Gene,
#   group_SQL_Well       =  SELECT Per_Image_Table.TableNumber, Per_Image_Table.ImageNumber, Per_Image_Table.well FROM Per_Image_Table
#   group_SQL_Gene       =  SELECT Per_Image_Table.TableNumber, Per_Image_Table.ImageNumber, Well_ID_Table.gene FROM Per_Image_Table, Well_ID_Table WHERE Per_Image_Table.well=Well_ID_Table.well
#   group_SQL_Well+Gene  =  SELECT Per_Image_Table.TableNumber, Per_Image_Table.ImageNumber, Well_ID_Table.well, Well_ID_Table.gene FROM Per_Image_Table, Well_ID_Table WHERE Per_Image_Table.well=Well_ID_Table.well

# ==== Image Filters ====
# Here you can define image filters to let you select objects from a subset of your experiment when training the classifier.
# This is OPTIONAL, you may leave "filters = ".
# FORMAT:
#   filters         =  comma separated list of filter names (MUST END IN A COMMA IF THERE IS ONLY ONE FILTER)
#   filter_SQL_XXX  =  MySQL select statement that returns image keys you wish to filter out.  This will be associated with the filter name "XXX" from above.
# EXAMPLE FILTERS:
#   filters           =  EMPTY, CDKs,
#   filter_SQL_EMPTY  =  SELECT TableNumber, ImageNumber FROM CPA_per_image, Well_ID_Table WHERE CPA_per_image.well=Well_ID_Table.well AND Well_ID_Table.Gene="EMPTY"

# FORMAT:
#   object_name  =  singular object name, plural object name,

# ==== Excluded Columns ====

#classifier_ignore_substrings  = table_number_key_column, image_number_key_column, object_number_key_column

# ==== Internal Cache ====
# It shouldn't be necessary to cache your images in the application, but the cache sizes can be set here.
